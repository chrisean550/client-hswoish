                            Hi! My name is Hannah, you can call me Han too. I grew up 
                            in Atlanta, GA but have been calling Pittsburgh my home for
                            the last 3 years after deciding to pursue my college career
                             at the University of Pittsburgh. I am a self-taught artist
                            and mainly work with acrylics and charcoals. Iâ€™d say a lot
                            of my art content revolves around a sense of bringing an
                            emotion to life. When I put a brush onto canvas or a pencil
                            onto paper, I fully immerse myself into the body of work and
                            thus usually see a lot of my emotion poured out onto the piece.
                            Art is where I feel comfortable to express who I am. My art is an
                            extension of myself.
